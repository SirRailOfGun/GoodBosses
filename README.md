To contribute a new boss rework, pull and branch MASTER, then merge back to MASTER once the new AI is done. This should keep merge conflicts to AIAdjuster.cs
To contribute to an existing boss rework, pull and push to that branch. 
Skeletron is currently being done in MASTER because I didn't think to branch for each boss before pushing the new code.
